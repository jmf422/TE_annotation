Please note that the "get_family_summary_paper.sh" script is a custom script that has been tested only on our local CentOS machines. It is provided mainly for reproducibility purposes and to demonstrate the logic of the perfect, good, and present categories. If you use the script in a different environment such as Ubuntu, we recommend independently validating it. Jullien Flynn (jmf422@cornell.edu) can be contacted with questions.
